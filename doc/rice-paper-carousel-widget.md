The Rice Paper carousel widget encapsulates a simple and flexible way to build carousel layout components with image, text or any other content that a standard WordPress post can hold. A custom post type working like a standard WordPress post defines each slide, and a custom taxonomy of categories and tags defines collections of slides grouped into carousels. A single carousel slide easily works with several carousel collections.

The widget is useful for building carousel layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a [built-in WordPress template tag](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_widget/), may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template. The Rice Paper carousel widget is built on the highly popular and feature-rich [Slick carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).
