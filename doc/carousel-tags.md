The Rice Paper carousel widget uses a custom taxonomy built on the the standard WordPress tag feature to define collections of carousel slides used in a carousel layout component. These are managed identically to the standard [WordPress tags](http://ewp.guide/go/tags). To go to the carousels tags management screen, hover the mouse pointer over the Carousel Slides dashboard menu item, then select "Carousels" from the fly-out menu. From this admin screen, define new carousel layout components, or edit existing ones. The slug field is used within the Rice Paper carousel widget to select a collection of slides.
