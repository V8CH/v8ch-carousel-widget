The carousel slides custom post type uses the title and main content (editor) fields from a standard post. Enter the title of the carousel slide, and enter any standard WordPress content in the content editor. As with a standard post, images may be placed either as a <a href="http://ewp.guide/go/setting-a-featured-image">featured image</a> or <a href="http://ewp.guide/go/inserting-an-image">inline</a> with other content in the main content editor.

To add a carousel slide to a collection of slides in a carousel component, enter a carousel tag in the box marked "Carousels." This box functions identically to standard [WordPress tags](http://ewp.guide/go/tags). A new carousel tag may be entered, or an existing one selected. A single carousel slide may be assigned to any number of carousel components. Add carousel tags for all of the carousel collections where the slide should appear. To remove a carousel slide from a carousel collection, simply delete the correct carousel tag.
