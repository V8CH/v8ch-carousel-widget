A single carousel slide easily works with several carousel collections.</p><p>The widget is useful for building carousel layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_widget/">built-in WordPress template tag</a>, may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template.
