    "description" : "The Rice Paper carousel widget encapsulates a simple and flexible way to build carousel layout components with image, text or any other content that a standard WordPress post can hold. A custom post type working like a standard WordPress post defines each slide, and a custom taxonomy of categories and tags defines collections of slides grouped into carousels. A single carousel slide easily works with several carousel collections."
