Description
-----------

The Rice Paper carousel widget encapsulates a simple and flexible way to build carousel layout components with image, text or any other content that a standard WordPress post can hold. A custom post type working like a standard WordPress post defines each slide, and a custom taxonomy of categories and tags defines collections of slides grouped into carousels. A single carousel slide easily works with several carousel collections.

The widget is useful for building carousel layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a [built-in WordPress template tag](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_widget/), may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template. The Rice Paper carousel widget is built on the highly popular and feature-rich [Slick carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).

Installation
------------

The Rice Paper theme and custom plugins are only available when bundled with deliverables presented by V8CH as part of a WordPress website development project. Once a website project has launched, copies of all V8CH themes and plugins are available by logging in to the V8CH website. Though they do not appear in the WordPress plugin repository, installation uses standard tools for [manual installation](http://ewp.guide/go/adding-new-plugin).

### Updates

Updates for all themes and plugins appear automatically using the [built-in WordPress updates system](http://ewp.guide/go/keeping-your-site-updated). All updates are tested before release, but it is good practice to perform a complete backup of all your data before updating any part of the WordPress system: core files, themes or plugins.
